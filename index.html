                <p>Can there be such a dream?
                    Maybe my own world it seems-
                    Somewhere of no hurry,
                    No rush for the hours,
                    Just me and you,
                    Just the time that flew,
                    Just by the winds so new,
                    Just like that,
                    The time would then somewhat freeze,
                    Suddenly everything would actually feel meaningless,
                    The Moon would talk about us,
                    The sun would patiently listen,
                    No worries of a new day,
                    A new night to remember,
                    Just a single night,
                    Once & forever,
                    Would Heaven grant me such a deal?
                    Cause For you,
                    I always will...ðŸ’—</p>
